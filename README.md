# Project Web Development 1

## Proposal
#### The concept:
A secure web application for keeping track of movies/shows you still want to watch or have already watched.
The records of this will be account bound, so to be able to create a list, an account has to first be created.
<br><br>
```
The application will be fairly simple, but here are the general steps:
1. Create an account.
2. Login with the newly created account.
   - forgetting a password will be no problem, with the forget password feature that will ask you to enter your email
   and the server will provide you with a link to reset your password.
3. Create a new list.
4. Give the list a name.
5. Option for adding movie or adding show.
   - Movie:
        - Will ask for title as required field.
        - Optional fields include duration in minutes, director/writer name, and uploading a picture for that movie.
   - Shows:
     - Will ask for title as mandatory field.
     - Optional fields include number of episodes, director/writer name, and uploading a picture.
6. Save the list.
7. Option for editing the list (deleting, editing, and adding movies/shows in the list)
```

I will develop this project with later expansion in mind. It is something I wanted to develop as a hobby already 
and in the future add features like adding it to a planning and syncing that planning with online calendars, 
so the user can also plan when he will watch them, and many more features like shared lists to plan a movienight for example.
